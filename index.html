        Introduction

      <p>
        Hi, my name is Khalil, I have been playing basketball since I was around
        5. Basketball has always been my favorite sport because my brothers
        would always talk about it to me and it influenced me to start playing.
        I started playing real basketball at the age of 12. My first team was
        the New York Gauchos. I had found out about Gauchos from my brother they
        had told me that this team was a very good team and it wasn't far from
        my house. Gauchos has been opened since 1985 and many known players have
        played for that team when they were younger such as Kyrie Irving, Kemba
        Walker and etc.
